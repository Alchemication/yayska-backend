# Coding Standards
- Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for all Python code.
- Use Black for code formatting to ensure consistency.
- Prefer standard library modules over external packages when feasible.
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values.
- Maintain docstrings following Google style format.
- Use native types instead of Typing package if possible.

# Package Management
- Utilize 'uv' for managing project dependencies (use `uv add <package>` to add a new dependency).
- Keep pyproject.toml up to date.
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds.

# Database Interaction
- Employ SQLAlchemy for database operations.
- Name database tables in plural form when possible.
- Implement all database schema changes using Alembic.
- Use SQLAlchemy's declarative base for model definitions.
- Include database indexes for frequently queried fields.
- When adding a new table:
    - Ensure primary key field `id` is auto incrementing.
    - Add new model (app/models), schema (app/schemas), ensure files are suffixed with the type, for example: user_model, user_schema, and classes contain Model suffix (do not forget the imports in models!)
    - Ensure it has the created_on, updated_on (nullable) and deleted_on (nullable) fields.
    - Ensure model is added to the alembic/env.py file to enable migrations.
- When a model is updated, prefer --autogenerate flag in migrations, do not generate the migration file unless can not be generated automatically.
- Migrations are created in the alembic folder.
- By default, do not automatically generate a new endpoint or tests with Composer, unless explicitly asked.

# Testing Guidelines
- Develop integration tests without mocking objects.
- Use real databases and services for testing purposes.
- Use pytest as the testing framework.

# Security
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper input validation.
